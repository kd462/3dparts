### CSCE 462 Project 3D Print Files 

The latest versions of each file are included in this repository, as well as some files that were not used in the final project. Models were created in Autodesk Inventor, sliced with PrusaSlicer, and printed with a RatRig V-Minion 3D printer.

This repository is licensed under the MIT license, with the hope that our work may help others at Texas A&M and elsewhere in the future.
